                    <p class="mb-4">Please read these terms of registerations carefully before using Our Service.</p>
                    <b>Terms and Conditions of Registration:</b>
                    <p>In connection with the registration pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall in its sole discretion determine the terms and conditions of such registration, including, without limitation, the timing thereof; the scope of the offering contemplated thereby (i.e., whether the offering shall be a combined primary offering and a secondary offering or limited only to a secondary offering); the manner of distribution of Registrable Shares consistent with the plan of distribution agreed upon by the Company and the Stockholders; the period of effectiveness of registration for permissible sales of Registrable Securities thereunder subject to the provisions of Section 4(a) hereof; and all other material aspects of the registration and the registration process to the extent consistent herewith. In connection therewith, the Company may require that any such registration be underwritten, in which event (i) the managing underwriter shall be selected by the Company and (ii) the inclusion of Registrable Shares in such registration shall be conditioned upon each holder thereof entering into an underwriting agreement in customary form with such underwriters participating in such registration.</p>
                    <b class="d-block mt-4">About these Terms</b>
                    <ol class="list-style-auto ps-4 mb-4">
                        <li>To pursue its goals, EIndustrify operates a communication web site (hereinafter the “Website”) devised to offer free contents on climate science that are intended to be accessible to a broad audience, and to allow citizens and climate scientists to interact for the purpose of making climate science accessible to everyone. The Website is available at www.eIndustrify.org.</li>
                        <li>The Website has a Public Area which is accessible to all visitors (hereinafter the “User”). The Public Area offers free climate science articles as well as other public communications and forums. It also offers an Online Shop. The Website has a Members Area which is available to Users who are registered as Members and are logged in. The Members Area offers access to the peer review of manuscripts, to various members forums, activities and member-to-member communication channels.</li>
                        <li>The Website also allows Users to subscribe to news and updates without registering as a Member. Subscribing to news and updates does not grant access to the Members Area however.</li>
                        <li>Registration and subscription take place via a dedicated online form on the Website.</li>
                        <li>These Terms and Conditions of Registration and Membership (hereafter “Terms”) establish the conditions of registration and membership and the terms of use of the Members Area. A Member shall expressly accept these Terms on registration and is bound to comply with them.</li>
                        <li>Any new services, offered online in the Members Area after initial registration, shall also be governed by these Terms unless otherwise specified.</li>
                        <li>EIndustrify reserves the right to amend the present Terms at any time and without prior notice and shall inform Members of such amendments at their next log-in. Members shall accept such amendments by checking the appropriate checkbox. The accounts of Members who do not accept the amendments shall be blocked 14 days after notification of the amendments.</li>
                    </ol>


                    <b class="d-block">Registration</b>
                    <ol class="list-style-auto ps-4">
                        <li>Registration and membership is open to all natural persons over thirteen years of age who have an interest in the creation and sharing of accessible climate science. Users under sixteen years of age must first obtain the consent of a parent or guardian.</li>
                        <li>Each User shall only register once.</li>
                        <li>The User shall register online to become a Member of EIndustrify.</li>
                        <li>During the registration process, the User can, in addition, opt to become a Member of the Association. Members of the Association are Members of EIndustrify with additional accesses allowing them to participate in the General Assemblies and can be elected as Members of the Board of Directors.</li>
                        <li>Members of the Association shall expressly accept EIndustrify’s Statutes on registration and are bound to comply with them.</li>
                        <li>By registering with EIndustrify, the User accepts that most communications with EIndustrify and its Members will take place electronically.</li>
                        <li>It is the User’s responsibility to make sure that she/he has sufficient access to Internet to participate to the activities at the desired extent.</li>
                        <li>EIndustrify screens registration applications and reserves itself the right to reject a registration without stating the reasons.</li>
                        <li>Members of EIndustrify have access to a notification preferences page where they can define their preferences for the notifications sent to them by email. They have access to the Members Area and can participate in the various activities that are open to Members, depending on their role as a climate scientist or not and their functions.</li>
                        <li>Upon registration, Members are required to supply their name, email address, mail address, areas of interest and a password.</li>
                        <li>Members requesting to be registered as climate scientists are required in addition to supply an affiliation and a list of publications. EIndustrify’s team will verify that the member fulfills the necessary conditions for being registered as a climate scientist.</li>
                        <li>The necessary conditions for being registered as a climate scientist with EIndustrify at any moment in time are:</li>
                        <ul class="list-style-disc ps-4">
                            <li>Have published within the past 6 years, as one of the main authors, an article in a recognized peer reviewed scientific journal in the broad area of climate science; and</li>
                            <li>Have completed or be currently enrolled in a master or doctoral level education in climate science or in a related area of natural sciences.</li>

                        <li>It is expressly forbidden to place accounts at the disposal of third parties and to disclose access details to third parties.</li>
                        <li>For technical reasons, EIndustrify cannot establish with certainty whether a registered Member really is the person he/she claims to be. EIndustrify shall therefore provide no guarantee as to Members’ true identities. Members shall therefore be responsible for verifying other Member’s identities and shall contact EIndustrify in cases of suspicion.</li>
                        <li>Registration as a Member results in a contractual relationship (usage contract) between EIndustrify and the Member. By accepting the Terms, they become a contract component. The member receives a personal, non-transferable right, revocable at any time, to use the contents and services provided by the Website and undertakes to comply with these Terms and the restrictions set out in them during such use.</li>
                        <li>EIndustrify reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue individual services and/or sections of the Members Area, or all of them, at any time and without prior notice, in whole or in part. EIndustrify reserves the further right to limit or deny access to individual or all services, without prior notice at any time.</li>
